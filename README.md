# Evolutionary Algorithms Framework
 This project provides a generic framework for implementing and testing different evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for solving optimization problems. Evolutionary algorithms are a family of stochastic optimization methods that draw inspiration from biological evolution to generate candidate solutions and refine them over time.

 This framework includes an abstract class for a generic EA, called EvolutionaryAlgorithm, which defines the common methods and attributes that all EAs should implement. Additionally, a generic test class, called Test_EA, is provided, which implements the evaluation loop for the EvolutionaryAlgorithm class and its child classes, for estimating the VAMM measurement, the execution time and the success rate, and calculating the 95% confidence interval for the VAMM.

 The implementation of this framework is based on the concepts and techniques presented in the book "Fundamentos de la Computación Evolutiva" by Carmona and Galán, which covers the fundamentals of evolutionary computation, including genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, and genetic programming.

# Requirements
 This project requires Python 3.7 or later and the NumPy library.

# Getting Started
 To use this framework, you can start by creating a child class of the EvolutionaryAlgorithm class, which should implement the specific behavior of the EA for solving a particular optimization problem. Then, you can use the Test class to evaluate the performance of your EA implementation on different problem instances.

To create a child class of EvolutionaryAlgorithm, you should implement at least the following methods:

- initialize_population(): Initializes the population of candidate solutions.
- evaluate_population(): Evaluates the fitness of each candidate solution in the population.
- select_parents(): Selects a set of candidate solutions to use as parents for the next generation.
- crossover(): Generates new candidate solutions by combining the genetic material of two parent solutions.
- mutate(): Introduces small random changes to the genetic material of candidate solutions.

 You can then use the Test class to run experiments with your EA implementation, by specifying the problem instance to solve, the number of iterations to run, and the parameters for the EA (e.g., population size, crossover and mutation probabilities, etc.).
